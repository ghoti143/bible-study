# 1 Samuel

## 1
- There was a man named Ramathain-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim who had two wives
- Hannah was one of his wives and she was barren
- The man loved Hannah and gave her a double portion of the sacrifice; but still she was sad because she was barren
- Hannah wept to the LORD and asked for a child; Eli the priest thought she was drunk
- Eli told Hannah to go in peace; the Lord remembered her prayers; she conceived
- Hannah gave birth to Samuel; after he was weaned, she took him to Shiloh to make sacrifices and dedicate him to the LORD

## 2
- Hannah prays in thanksgiving to God
- Eli's sons were worthless; they took the sacrificial meat before it was roasted
- Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli
- Eli blessed Hannah and she conceived again; three sons, two daughters
- Eli rebukes his sons; Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man
- A man of God comes to Eli and God rebukes him; God has given great blessings to Eli's father's house but they have dishonored him
- God says Hophni and Phinehas will die as a sign of God's rebuke
- God promises to raise up a faithful priest who will go in and out before His anointed forever.

## 3
- Samuel is sleeping next to the Ark of God; the LORD keeps calling Samuel
- Samuel goes into Eli and says Here I am; Eli perceived that the LORD was calling Samuel
- Samuel answered the LORD and said Speak your servant hears
- The LORD tells Samuel that his plan is about to come to pass; that Eli's house and sons will be overthrown
- Sameul was afraid to tell the vision to Eli
- Eli convinced Samuel to tell him the vision; he said it is the LORD'; let Him do what seems good to Him
- Samuel grew and treasured God's word; all of Israel knew that Samuel was a prophet
- The LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh

## 4
- Israel went to battle against Philistines
- Israel lost so they decided to bring the Ark from Shiloh; they shouted when it arrived in the camp
- Israel was defeated again; the Philistines captured the ark; Eli’s sons died
- When Eli was told of what happened he fell over backwards and died; he had judged Israel for 40 years
- His daughter in law gave birth when she heard that her husband was dead and the ark captured; she named her child Ichabod because “the glory has departed from Israel”

## 5
- The Philistines set the Ark next to Dagon in Ashdod.
- Dagon kept falling down next to the Ark; the people of Ashdod were afflicted with boils
- They sent the Ark to Gath; those people were also afflicted with sores
- They decided to return the Ark because the hand of God was heavy with them

## 6
- The Philistine priests instruct to return the Ark with 5 golden tumors and 5 golden mice; perhaps He will lighten His hand b/c of this
- Don't harden your heart like Pharoh instruct the Philistine priests
- They instruct to set the Ark on an unmaned cow cart along with the golden images and set it off
- The cart went directly to Beth-shemesh to Joshua's field; the Israelites burned the cart and the cows as an offering of thanksgiving
- The golden tumors represent Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; the five Philistine cities belonging to the great Philistine lords.
- The stone beside which the Ark was unloaded stands witness in Joshua's field
- God struck 70 men of Beth-shemesh who looked upon the ark; they told Kiriath-jearim to come get the ark

## 7
- Kiriath-jearim received the ark; they consecrated Eleazar to have charge of it; for 20 years they lamented after the LORD
- Samuel told Israel to put away Baals and Ashtaroth if they intend to return to the LORD
- The Israelites gathered at Mizpah and Samuel prayed for them; they drew water and poured it out before LORD and confessed their sins
- Samuel made a burnt offering sacrifice from a young lamb
- The Philistines tried to attack but God threw them into confusion and they were defeated
- Samuel setup a stone and called it Ebenezer because “till now the Lord has helped us”
- The hand of the Lord was against Philistine all of Samuels days and lands were returned
- Samuel judges Israel all his days, went on circuit tours around the cities and built an alter in his hometown of Ramah

## 8
- In his old age, Samuel made his sons judges over Israel but they were unrighteous judges
- The elders of Israel asked Samuel to appoint a king; this displeased Samuel
- God told Samuel to obey the people; they have not rejected Samuel but God as their king
- Samuel relays God’s message to Israel about the king they will receive: he will be a slavedriver and will heavily tax the people
- When the people cry out for help, God will not answer them
- The people didn’t obey Samuel’s voice and insisted on having a king; God tells Samuel to make them a king
- Samuel tells the men of Israel to return to their own cities
