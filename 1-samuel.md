# 1 Samuel

## 1
- There was a man named Ramathain-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim who had two wives
- Hannah was one of his wives and she was barren
- The man loved Hannah and gave her a double portion of the sacrifice; but still she was sad because she was barren
- Hannah wept to the LORD and asked for a child; Eli the priest thought she was drunk
- Eli told Hannah to go in peace; the Lord remembered her prayers; she conceived
- Hannah gave birth to Samuel; after he was weaned, she took him to Shiloh to make sacrifices and dedicate him to the LORD

## 2
- Hannah prays in thanksgiving to God
- Eli's sons were worthless; they took the sacrificial meat before it was roasted
- Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli
- Eli blessed Hannah and she conceived again; three sons, two daughters
- Eli rebukes his sons; Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man
- A man of God comes to Eli and God rebukes him; God has given great blessings to Eli's father's house but they have dishonored him
- God says Hophni and Phinehas will die as a sign of God's rebuke
- God promises to raise up a faithful priest who will go in and out before His anointed forever.
