# 1 Samuel

## 1
- There was a man named Ramathain-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim who had two wives
- Hannah was one of his wives and she was barren
- The man loved Hannah and gave her a double portion of the sacrifice; but still she was sad because she was barren
- Hannah wept to the LORD and asked for a child; Eli the priest thought she was drunk
- Eli told Hannah to go in peace; the Lord remembered her prayers; she conceived
- Hannah gave birth to Samuel; after he was weaned, she took him to Shiloh to make sacrifices and dedicate him to the LORD
