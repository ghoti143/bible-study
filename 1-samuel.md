# 1 Samuel

## 1
- There was a man named Ramathain-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim who had two wives
- Hannah was one of his wives and she was barren
- The man loved Hannah and gave her a double portion of the sacrifice; but still she was sad because she was barren
- Hannah wept to the LORD and asked for a child; Eli the priest thought she was drunk
- Eli told Hannah to go in peace; the Lord remembered her prayers; she conceived
- Hannah gave birth to Samuel; after he was weaned, she took him to Shiloh to make sacrifices and dedicate him to the LORD

## 2
- Hannah prays in thanksgiving to God
- Eli's sons were worthless; they took the sacrificial meat before it was roasted
- Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli
- Eli blessed Hannah and she conceived again; three sons, two daughters
- Eli rebukes his sons; Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man
- A man of God comes to Eli and God rebukes him; God has given great blessings to Eli's father's house but they have dishonored him
- God says Hophni and Phinehas will die as a sign of God's rebuke
- God promises to raise up a faithful priest who will go in and out before His anointed forever.

## 3
- Samuel is sleeping next to the Ark of God; the LORD keeps calling Samuel
- Samuel goes into Eli and says Here I am; Eli perceived that the LORD was calling Samuel
- Samuel answered the LORD and said Speak your servant hears
- The LORD tells Samuel that his plan is about to come to pass; that Eli's house and sons will be overthrown
- Sameul was afraid to tell the vision to Eli
- Eli convinced Samuel to tell him the vision; he said it is the LORD'; let Him do what seems good to Him
- Samuel grew and treasured God's word; all of Israel knew that Samuel was a prophet
- The LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh

## 4
- Israel went to battle against Philistines
- Israel lost so they decided to bring the Ark from Shiloh; they shouted when it arrived in the camp
- Israel was defeated again; the Philistines captured the ark; Eli’s sons died
- When Eli was told of what happened he fell over backwards and died; he had judged Israel for 40 years
- His daughter in law gave birth when she heard that her husband was dead and the ark captured; she named her child Ichabod because “the glory has departed from Israel”
