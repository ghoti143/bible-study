## 1
- The Israelites continue conquering Cannan
- Judah leads the charge
- They cut off the thumbs of a leader who used to do the same to people he conquered
- Fought against Jerusalem and captured it and burned it down
- Caleb offers his daughter for whoever captures Kiriath-sepher; Othniel wins
- Judah conquered the hill towns, but not the plains; plains people had iron chariots
- Benjamin couldn't drive out people from Jerusalem; they cohabit to this day
- Joseph drove out people of Bethel with help from a spy
- Manasseh, Ephraim, Zubulan, Asher and Naphtali failed to drive out Cannanites; they were forced into labor
